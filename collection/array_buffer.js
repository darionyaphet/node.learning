//The ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. 
//You can not directly manipulate the contents of an ArrayBuffer; 
//instead, you create one of the typed array objects or a DataView object which represents the buffer in a specific format, and use that to read and write the contents of the buffer.
